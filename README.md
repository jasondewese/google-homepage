This is my first ever attempt at applying HTML and CSS by recreating the Google homepage!

Here is a list of all of the skills this project demonstrates and what I learned:

This project demonstrates my ability to use HTML and CSS code to replicate the format and style of an exisiting website. I used CSS Grid to organize all of the HTML elements on the page into the correct location. Then I implemented CSS Flexbox properties within the grid items to align and control the individual links and button placement. 

I used chrome developer tools to match some of the colors on the page exactly. 

I was able to implement :hover states in CSS for my links, buttons, and search bar so the page feels interactive just like the real Google home page. 

To improve accessibility, I added the new HTML5 tags header, main, and footer. I also included alternate text to my Google logo image.

Throughout the project I used Git to save each new version of the project and maintain a log of all changes made to each version. 

I also consistently used the Linux terminal for all git commands, and to navigate through and open my files for editing in the VSCode text editor. I used the Live Server extension to auto refresh my webpage each time I saved my work so I could see the changes without clicking refresh each time. 

Wow...I learned a lot!
